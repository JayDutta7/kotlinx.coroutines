 * Transforms elements emitted by the original flow by applying [mapper], that returns another flow, and then merging and flattening these flows.
 *
 * Note that even though this operator looks very familiar, we discourage its usage in a regular application-specific flows.
 * Most likely, suspending operation in [map] operator will be sufficient and linear transformations are much easier to reason about.
 *
 * With [bufferSize] parameter, one can control the size of backpressure aka the amount of queued in-flight elements.
